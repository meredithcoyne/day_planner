# day_planner

## Functionality
* When the website is opened, the current date and time are posted at the top.
* When scrolled down, the user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours (from 9AM to 6PM)
* When the user views the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. The user can click into the time block and enter an event.
    * #d3d3d3 Past
    * #ff6961 Present
    * #77dd77 Future
* When clicking on the save button on the right for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage. So, when the page is refreshed, the saved events persist.
